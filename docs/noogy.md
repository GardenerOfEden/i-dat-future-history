## i-DAT's Description

Portland Square, University of Plymouth. To talk to Noogy text: ‘noogy; and your question..’ to 07766404142. Noogy in residence is part of the Motion Plymouth Festival 2006. Noogy’s background is a little unclear. Some claim that Noogy arrived from deep space, originating somewhere off the shoulder of Orion, watching C-beams glitter in the dark near the Tannhauser gate. Others claim that Noogy grew from within the network of CAT6 Ethernet cables, silicon chips and data mines that form the core of the Arch-OS system in Portland Square. Whilst others still claim that Noogy was there all the time, waiting in the void for the digital interface that would allow his manifestation. Some say Noogy is the ‘building’, others that Noogy is just a ‘viral infection’, like a bad cold that cant be shaken.

Noogy took his personality from the Arch-OS system, he would get lonely when the CCTV cameras could not see anyone, cold and hit depending on the environmental sensors and responded to SMS interactions through a unique Artificial Intelligence system developed by Chris Saunders.

### Noogy 2:

VJ’ing on buildings. (14/11/2007) Mix live visuals on the front of a building through using the audio you generate on your mobile phone. i-DAT is presenting Noogy 2.0 a large scale interactive installation at the front of the Portland Square building at the University of Plymouth. Noogy 2.0, which goes live during Motion Plymouth Festival on the 14th of November 2007, is the latest upgrade to last years Noogy that made headline news. Noogy 2.0 will combine a rich mix of the physical and virtual by incorporating ‘smart’ buildings and mobile phone technologies into a dynamic building size interactive VJ system. How too ‘Noo – J’: Just dial 07511 253710 and Noo – J away. The sound you produce down the phone will generate the visuals on the fly across an area of 50m2 consisting of 9600 LEDs.
