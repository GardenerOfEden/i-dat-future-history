# This is Where We Are

*This Is Where We Are (TIWWA)* is an immersive and interactive sculpture that is fueled by data that we 
collectively generate.
Engage, interact and play with the swarm algorithms that generate this dynamic digital artwork.
Data can be found everyday and it is all around us, whether that be from the messages and the phone calls we make on our phones to the distance we travel each and everyday. Well, TIWWA invites audiences into a sculptural space where they can see, hear and interact with the data of our everyday lives.
TIWWA was created by i-DAT working with Tate Collective London for the opening of the new [*Tate Modern building 
on the 17 – 19 June 2016.*](https://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-modern/special-event/new-tate-modern-opening-weekend/where-we-are)

Data is created all around us – from our interactions with social media to our movements through a city. The sculpture is always adapting and changing depending on the data that it explores. It looks at behavioural data such as its sensors will capture collective movement and touch through the studio space. It also explores social media data so hashtags used will collect the ideas and attitudes of past, present and future audiences. Finally, it also looks at environmental data where it will create 3D virtual environment from the architects design of the new Tate Modern Building. TIWWA invites audiences into a sculptural space where they can see, hear and interact with the data of our everyday lives, contributing to an evolving art work which questions the influence of algorithms on our behaviour.

**The artwork explored:**

- Behavioural data: individual and collective movement and touch. Sensors will capture our collective movements through the studio space.

- Social media data: Hashtags #Tatemodern will help collect the ideas and sentiment of present and distant audiences.

- Environmental data: Temperature, Co2, Humidity and Energy Consumption, captured by the Buildings Energy Management System, 
  representing the life of the building and the collective behaviour of its inhabitants.

## "A technological fusion of interactive light and sound, this dynamic data driven artwork asks audiences to consider the data they generate and the algorithms that increasingly influence their behaviour. This Is Where We Are offers a glimpse into a future where we work rest and play with and through algorithms."
