<h1>This is Where We Are<h1>

TIWWA is an immersive and interactive sculpture that is fueled by data that is collected.
Engage, interact and play with the swarm algorithms that generate this dynamic digital artwork.
Data can be found everyday and it is all around us, whether that be from the messages and the phone calls we make on our phones to the distance we travel each and everyday. Well, TIWWA invites audiences into a sculptural space where they can see, hear and interact with the data of our everyday lives.

The sculpture is always adapting and changing depending on the data that it explores. It looks at behavioural data such as its sensors will capture collective movement and touch through the studio space. It also explores social media data so hashtags used will collect the ideas and attitudes of past, present and future audiences. Finally, it also looks at environmental data where it will create 3D virtual environment from the architects design of the new Tate Modern Building.
