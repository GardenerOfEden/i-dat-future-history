<h1>WOMEN RECLAIMING AI FOR ACTIVISM<h1>

In this workshop you will learn all about conversational AI – commonly known as ‘chatbots’ or ‘voice assistants.’ 
AI and develop a collaborative AI Voice Assistant.

We invite you to a workshop for women and people who do not primarily identify as male to create an AI assistant 
that reflects female identity, using inspirational speech from women we admire. The workshop will be a fun, sharing 
collaborative space, we will talk and share ideas while programming our AIs. No previous experience of coding required.

AI voice assistants like Ok Google, Alexa, Siri, Cortana and Bixby use female names, identities, voices (as a response 
to pressure an increasing number now have an option to change the gender of the voice to male). Studies revealed that 
both men and women respond more favourably to female speech and want their AI assistant to be ‘obedient and assisting.’ 
Culturally we are used to hearing female voices in subordinate/service roles and therefore on the whole we are more 
comfortable with a female voiced AI assistant.

This workshops is a response to the lack of gender diversity in the development of AI systems. The project looks to 
develop an AI voice assistant programmed through collaborative workshops with women and people who do not primarily 
identify as male.
