# Senti-Mental

22 October 2016, 11am – 3pm, the ground floor of Plymouth University’s iconic Roland Levinsky Building.
Senti-Mental is a ludic brain model derived from a melding of an MRI scan and real-time twitter feeds 
scrapped form the collective mind of the Off-The Lip event. Tweets run through a sentiment analysis filter 
which impacts on colour and activity within the low-polygon-volumetric-model extracted from an MRI scan of head 
and brain. Looking more like a crystal-cave than a grey-jelly Senti-Mental is illuminated by the hive mind of visitors 
to the event.

Senti-Mental incorporates aspects of i-DAT’s Quarum Sensing Project which explores cultural computation, ludic data 
and playful experimentation with creative technology. Quorum is an algorithmic system that feeds off data generated 
by material and virtual environments and the physical and social behaviour of audiences. It incorporates bio-inspired 
algorithmic swarm decentralised decision making processes to generate a dynamic and evolving collective
