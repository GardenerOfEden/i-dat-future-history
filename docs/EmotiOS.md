# Emoti-OS

**I found some information about a project i-DAT did called Emoti-OS, which is a chat bot designed to find out the collective mood of students at the college of art.**

Emoti-OS was a way for students from the Plymouth College of Arts to express how they felt about the course and uni life anonymously to an AI, to avoid the awkwardness of complaining to a real human. Developed in 2017, Emoti-OS was designed specifically to recognise emotions and give emotional responses.

Whilst a version of Emoti-OS is available for smart-phones or in browser use, the main exhibit was a monitor hooked up to 7 emotive buttons. [Here is a gallery of Emoti-OS and some students using it.](https://www.flickr.com/photos/109085185@N04/38006321944/in/album-72157691108120646)

The project was a joint collaboration between Plymouth School of Creative Arts, Intercity and Controlled Frenzy. Emoti-OS was designed to be a chatbot with both visual and emotive responses to students feedback, collecting information about general opinions in real time. It was able to distinguish between 7 emotions through the tone of the conversation: joy, sadness, excitement, fear, confusion, anger and disgust. 

In the first 10 days of being launched, Emoti-OS received over 14,000 emoji responses, with over 800 conversations with students. This shows what a success the project was, as it got people reacting very quickly. 

You can still chat to Emoti-OS at [emoti-os.me.](emoti-os.me) However, at the time of writing this, Emoti seems to be unresponsive (I don't know if it's a bug or if it shuts down overnight). 

This is a good example of machine learning as the AI within Emoti was collecting and sorting data and students responses at the same time as engaging with the students via conversation. The conversations were purely AI generated, based on how the students reacted to Emoti. If a student felt sad, for example, Emoti would pick up on this and ask "why are you sad?" and "Is there anything I can do to help?". There was also a 'Harm Protocol' coded within Emoti, so if a student sounded like they were in danger, they could enter their details and be immediately contacted by a member of the School of Creative Arts safeguarding team.
