<h1>The Immersive Vision Theatre<h1>

https://i-dat.org/ivt/

The immersive Vision Theatre is a 41 seater projection theatre. It contains a Fish-Eye projector and 
customised powerful computers to wrap data, models, video and images around its inner surface. It 
is based on the William Day Planetarium which was built in 1967 and it was reborn when the IVT was 
made and introduced.

There is also a 5-metre inflatable portbale dome that is used around schools and exhibitions so people around the country can see what the IVT has to offer without having to visit it. 
The IVT is used for a range of learning, entertainment and research activities, including transdisciplinary teaching, bleeding edge research in modelling and data visualisation. We can fly you to the edge of the observable Universe, across microscopic nano-landscapes, or immerse you in interactive data-scapes.
