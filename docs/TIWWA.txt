*This Is Where We Are (TIWWA)* is an immersive and interactive algorithmic sculpture fuelled by the data we 
collectively generate. Engage, interact and play with the swarm algorithms that generate this dynamic digital 
artwork created by i-DAT working with Tate Collective London for the opening of the new [*Tate Modern building 
on the 17 – 19 June 2016.*](https://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-modern/special-event/new-tate-modern-opening-weekend/where-we-are)

Data is created all around us – from our interactions with social media to our movements through a city. 
TIWWA invites audiences into a sculptural space where they can see, hear and interact with the data of our everyday 
lives, contributing to an evolving art work which questions the influence of algorithms on our behaviour.


**The artwork will explore:**

- Behavioural data: individual and collective movement and touch. Sensors will capture our collective movements through the studio space.

- Social media data: Hashtags #Tatemodern will help collect the ideas and sentiment of present and distant audiences.

- Environmental data: Temperature, Co2, Humidity and Energy Consumption, captured by the Buildings Energy Management System, 
  representing the life of the building and the collective behaviour of its inhabitants.


## "A technological fusion of interactive light and sound, this dynamic data driven artwork asks 
## audiences to consider the data they generate and the algorithms that increasingly influence their behaviour. 
## This Is Where We Are offers a glimpse into a future where we work rest and play with and through algorithms."
