## i-DAT's Description

MArtory is a free app developed by i-DAT and partners that leads users to Plymouth’s culture hotspots and then rewards them with exclusive offers.
Artory-users earn Art Miles by visiting venues and leaving feedback. These can be exchanged in participating cultural venues all over the city for drinks, discounts and VIP offers.

Venues and attractions fill the app with their what’s on listings and events, helping to promote Plymouth’s cultural assets to a connected audience of city residents and visitors.

Art Miles earned in one venue can be used in another venues, thanks to the collaborative approach taken by the organisations involved in developing Artory.
Although what’s on apps are commonplace, the crucial difference with Artory is that it offers visitors incentives for leaving feedback about what they thought about the show, the exhibition, the film or the attraction.

This is because Artory is based on the ‘analytics engine’ Qualia, developed by i-DAT at Plymouth University, University of Warwick and Cheltenham Festivals 2013. This mood-measuring technology makes it easy for app-users to record their feelings and emotions about the art and culture they’ve just viewed.
This is a huge step forward from the usual feedback forms that present culture fans with paperwork just after they’ve experienced a show or a performance.
Evaluating audience feedback is a vital task for culture organisations, giving them important information that can support funding applications or direct future programming. So by making that data-collection easy, fun and tangibly rewarding, Artory helps both the city’s culture attractions and its visitors.
This city-wide initiative has been led, designed and produced by i-DAT and Plymouth Arts Centre (in conjunction with Elixel and the Plymouth Culture Guide Group: Theatre Royal, Barbican Theatre, Plymouth City Museum and Gallery, The Gallery Plymouth College of Art, Peninsula Arts Plymouth University, KARST, Ocean Studios, Take a Part, Effervescent, Plymouth Dance, Plymouth Culture Board).

The app is funded by i-DAT, Plymouth Arts Centre, Destination Plymouth, Plymouth City Council and Plymouth Culture Board.

The software behind Artory is open-source, meaning that once it has been piloted in Plymouth, it will be available for use by other cities to promote their cultural activity.

Venues participating at present include Theatre Royal, Plymouth City Museum and Art Gallery, Ocean Studios, Peninsula Arts at Plymouth University, Barbican Theatre, KARST, The Gallery at Plymouth College of Art, Take a Part, and Plymouth Dance.

Other arts and culture organisations interested in being involved in Artory can contact Birgitte Aga at i-DAT via birgitte.aga@plymouth.ac.uk
Artory will be available in app stores for both iPhones and Android devices from December 15, 2014. The app’s official launch will be in January 2015.

## Project Website Description

After three years and a successful pilot, Artory, Plymouth’s incentivised ‘What’s On’ Mobile App for cultural events is going offline.

Artory was launched in January 2015 as a pilot scheme to enable users to leave feedback and cultural organisations to understand their audiences better. It provided users with an opportunity to evaluate events and shows, whilst receiving cultural event info directly to their phones.

This city-wide collaborative pilot was produced by i-DAT and Plymouth Arts Centre with the Plymouth Culture Guide Group: Theatre Royal Plymouth, Barbican Theatre, Plymouth City Museum and Gallery, The Gallery at Plymouth College of Art, Peninsula Arts Plymouth University, KARST, Ocean Studios, Take a Part, Plymouth Dance and Plymouth Culture. The App was designed and developed by Elixel with i-DAT. The branding was designed by Intercity.

To date Artory has:

- Engaged 25 arts and culture partner organisations
- Promoted 2041 events
- Provided 12,015 pieces of feedback
- Had 6201 downloads across IOS and android devices.
- Had 5129 visitors to the website

We will continue to explore any potential routes to fund a new web and mobile enabled Artory. In the meantime, we will cease working on the app from October 31st 2017. The app will be removed from the App store and only accessible to those who have downloaded it, (although it will also no longer be supported). We would therefore suggest you remove the app from your phone after this time.
